# pfiers.net

My portfolio website, live at [pfiers.net](https://pfiers.net).

Single-page application written in [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and [SCSS](https://github.com/sass/sass) using [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) as the frontend framework, [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) for transpiling, [Presite](https://github.com/egoist/presite) for prerendering and [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to put it all together.

Also, it's editable in your browser, [check it out](https://pfiers.net/edit)!
