# pfiers.net 📜

My portfolio website, live at [pfiers.net](https://pfiers.net).

A hybrid statically-generated and single-page application built with
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It's
accessible, adaptive, and uses progressive enhancement to ensure anyone can
access the site 🌍, regardless of JS support, device, or the user agent of choice
(screen reader, large font etc.).

While enabled, the client-side JavaScript is currently only used to make
navigating between pages snappier and to enable the dark mode toggle. Eventually
I'd like to bring back the ✏️ button from the [Vue 3
version](https://github.com/ubipo/pfiers.net/tree/old-vue3) of this site.
