{dropword}`Hi!`I like maps, machine learning and
microcontrollers. This site is a home to showcase my favorite
[projects](/projects), and the [technologies](/technologies) used to build them.

Read about [Pathy](/projects/pathy), a small rover that autonomously follows
forest paths, or check out my [IoT](/projects/iot) projects (now with 100% more
garage gate hacking), or just [browse them all](/projects).
