      OCR water usage monitoring. Consisting of an
      [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266) + 
      [Arducam](https://www.arducam.com/) and a 
      [Python Flask server](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)
      with a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) neural net running on 
      a Raspberry Pi.

      This was my first foray into PCB design (I used
      [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/), by recommendation
      of [GreatScott](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6mIxFTvXkWQVEHPsEdflzQ)).
      It was also my first time creating something with machine vision.
      I used [Python Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) for the server
      and a homegrown [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 
      [neural net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network).

      Dynamic in more than one way, using [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) and
      [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) for 
      its content. Did you know you can [edit it](r:/edit)?

      ### And I can prove it!  
      See that little pencil button in the bottom right of the page?
      Click it to open a [live editor](/edit) of the site's content.

      ### But why?
      Simple: I wanted the [fast page transitions](e:https://lighthouse-dot-webdotdevsite.appspot.com//lh/html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpfiers.net) that come with client-side
      rendering.

      ### Doesn't that make the initial page load slow?
      Nope! :)  
      All pages are [pre-rendered](e:https://github.com/chrisvfritz/prerender-spa-plugin)
      when I publish [a new version](e:https://github.com/ubipo/pfiers.net/releases).
      And I usually publish a new version anytime I updated the site content.

      ### But wait, prerendering kinda defeats the purpose of a SPA then, right?
      Well yes and no.  
      No because the page transitions are still measurably faster.
      And yes because I have to run the prerender every time I update the content.
      Luckily I have [GitHub actions](e:https://github.com/ubipo/pfiers.net/actions) for that.

      I did want to include it here because interfacing with the
      real world is one of my favorite parts of computing.
